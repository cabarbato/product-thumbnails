A SPA using the test.json file from the [TestApplication repo](https://github.com/RepZio/TestApplication) to display the company name and logo, the sales rep's contact information, and a grid of thumbnails for all products in the JSON. Once a thumbnail is clicked, a modal is activated, displaying the product's name, price, ID, dimensions, and description. **[View the demo here.](https://cabarbato.github.io/product-thumbnails/)**
